         5. Log in to your [WordPress account](https://wordpress.com/log-in) and activate the extension in the **WordPress Plugin Manager**.
         6. Log in to your [Easy Digital Downloads account](https://easydigitaldownloads.com).
         7. Navigate to the **Settings** page and click the **Checkout/Payment Gateways** tab.
         8. Click **Razorpay** to edit the settings.
         9. Enable the Payment Method and name it Credit Card/Debit Card/Internet Banking (this will show up on the payment page your customer sees).
         10. Enter your `[KEY_ID]` and `[KEY_SECRET]`. Generate the [API Keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/authentication.md#generate-api-keys) from the Razorpay Dashboard.
         11. Click **Save** to save the changes.
        

## 2. Test Integration

After the integration, a **Pay** button will appear on your web page/app. You need to click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration works as expected. You can start accepting actual customer payments once the test is successful.

You can make test payments using one of the payment methods configured at the Checkout.
- No money is deducted from the customer's account as this is a simulated transaction.
- Ensure you have entered the API keys generated in the test mode in the Checkout code.

    
### Supported Payment Methods

         After the integration is complete, a **Pay** button appears on your webpage/app. 

Click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test transaction is successful.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> This is a mock payment page that uses your test API keys, test card and payment details. 
> - Ensure you have entered only your [Test Mode API keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) in the Checkout code. 
> - Test mode features a mock bank page with **Success** and **Failure** buttons to replicate the live payment experience.
> - No real money is deducted due to the usage of test API keys. This is a simulated transaction.
> 

Following are all the payment modes that the customer can use to complete the payment on the Checkout. Some of them are available by default, while others may require approval from us. Raise a request from the Dashboard to enable such payment methods.

### Verify Payment Status

        You can track the payment status from the Dashboard or by polling APIs.
        
            
                1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to **Transactions** → **Payments**.
                2. Check if a `payment_ID` has been generated and note the status. In case of a successful payment, the status is marked as `captured`.
                
                    
            
            
                  [Poll Payment APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/payments.md#fetch-multiple-payments) to check the payment status.
            
        
        

## 3. Go-live Checklist

Follow these steps before taking the integration live:

    
### 3.1 Accept Live Payments

         Perform an end-to-end simulation of funds flow in the Test Mode. Once confident that the integration is working as expected, switch to the Live Mode and start accepting payments from customers.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> Ensure you are switching your test API keys with API keys generated in Live Mode.
> 

To generate API Keys in Live Mode on your Razorpay Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to **Live Mode** on the menu.
1. Navigate to **Account & Settings** → **API Keys** → **Generate Key** to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
1. Download the keys and save them securely.
1. Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

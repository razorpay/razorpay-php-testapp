}
```

### Parameters

`id`
: `string` The unique identifier of the order.

`amount` _mandatory_
: `integer` Payment amount in the smallest currency sub-unit. For example, if the amount to be charged is , then pass `29900` in this field. In the case of three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD and OMR, to accept a payment of 295.991, pass the value as `295990`. And in the case of zero decimal currencies such as JPY, to accept a payment of 295, pass the value as `295`.

>     As per payment guidelines, you should pass the last decimal number as 0 for three decimal currency payments. For example, if you want to charge a customer 99.991 KD for a transaction, you should pass the value for the amount parameter as `99990` and not `99991`.

`amount_paid`
: `integer` The amount paid against the order.

`amount_due`

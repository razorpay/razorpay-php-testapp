description: Know how to integrate bank transfer as a payment method on Razorpay Custom Checkout.
---

# Bank Transfer on Custom Checkout

You can now accept payments from customers in the form of online bank transfers using the Razorpay Custom Checkout.

## How it Works

1. Customer selects bank transfer as the payment method on Checkout.
2. A Customer Identifier is created with the bank account number and IFSC details and displayed to the customer.
3. The customer copies these details and makes a netbanking payment from their online banking portal.

These Customer Identifiers are linked to the bank account you have registered with Razorpay. The payments are settled in your account as per the settlement schedule.

 to get this feature activated on your account.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a Razorpay Account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup).
- [Generate the API keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/authentication.md#generate-api-keys).
- Integrate with [Razorpay Custom Checkout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/custom.md).

## Integration Steps

1. [Create an order](#step-1-create-an-order).
2. [Add the `fetchVirtualAccount` method to the custom checkout integration](#step-2-add-fetchvirtualaccount-method-to-custom-checkout).
3. [Subscribe to the virtual account credited webhook event](#step-3-subscribe-to-webhook-event).

### Step 1: Create an Order

**Order is an important step in the payment process.**

- An order should be created for every payment.
- You can create an order using the [Orders API](#api-sample-code). It is a server-side API call. Know how to [authenticate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) Orders API.
- The `order_id` received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.
> 

You can create an order:
- Using the sample code on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.
- By manually integrating the API sample codes on your server.

#### Razorpay Postman Public Workspace

You can use the Postman workspace below to create an order:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/razorpaydev/workspace/razorpay-public-workspace/request/12492020-6f15a901-06ea-4224-b396-15cd94c6148d)

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> Under the **Authorization** section in Postman, select **Basic Auth** and add the Key Id and secret as the Username and Password, respectively.

### Request Parameters

`amount` _mandatory_
: `integer` Payment amount in the smallest currency subunit. For example, if the amount to be charged is , then pass `29900` in this field. In the case of three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD and OMR, to accept a payment of 295.991, pass the value as 295990. And in the case of zero decimal currencies such as JPY, to accept a payment of 295, pass the value as 295.

 
> **WARN**
>
> 
>  **Watch Out!**
> 
>  As per payment guidelines, you should pass the last decimal number as 0 for three decimal currency payments. For example, if you want to charge a customer 99.991 KD for a transaction, you should pass the value for the amount parameter as `99990` and not `99991`.

> **INFO**

> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> The above flow also works with the following cases:

> 1. With the Customer Fee bearer model, the amount validation should happen with Amount + Fee.
> 2. You can pass the customer id in Checkout to ensure that a static virtual account is created for each customer.

### Step 3: Subscribe to Webhook Event

You must subscribe to the `virtual_account.credited` webhook event on the Dashboard to receive notifications whenever customers make payments using bank transfers. Learn how to [setup webhooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/webhooks.md#set-up-webhooks).

## 1.2 Link SDK

- [iOS](#ios)
- [Android](#android)

#### iOS

#### Automatic

**Automatic linking is available only for iOS.**  The steps are given below:

1. Install the Razorpay React Native Custom UI SDK using the npm command.

      ```js: Install
      $ npm install react-native-customui --save
      ```

2. Navigate to the iOS folder on the terminal and run `pod install`.

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> Ensure the **Razorpay.framework** file is added in the embedded binaries section and that the **Always Embed Swift Standard Binaries** option is set to **Yes** in **Build Settings**.
> 

#### Manual (via CocoaPods)

You can link the SDK manually using CocoaPods. To do this:

1. Add the following line to your build targets in your Podfile. 

      ```
      pod 'react-native-customui', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-customui'
      ```

2. Run the following command: 

      ```
      pod install
      ```

#### Manual (without CocoaPods)

If you do not use CocoaPods, follow these steps to link the SDK manually:

1. In XCode, in the Project Navigator:
    - Right click **Libraries**.
    - Add Files to `[your project's name]`.
    - Navigate to `node_modules/react-native-customui`.
    - Add the `.xcodeproj` file.
2. In the project navigator, select your project.
    - Add the `libRNDeviceInfo.a` from the `deviceinfo` project to your project's **Build Phases** ➜ **Link Binary With Libraries**.
    - Click the `.xcodeproj` file you added before in the Project Navigator and navigate to the **Build Settings** tab. Ensure **All** is selected, and not **Basic**.
    - Look for **Header Search Paths** and ensure it contains both `$(SRCROOT)/../react-native/React` and `$(SRCROOT)/../../React`.
    - Mark both as recursive. It should be marked **OK** by default.
3. Run your project using **cmd+R**.

#### Expo Application

After adding the `react-native-razorpay` package, use the option to prebuild the app. This generates the **iOS** platform folders in the project to use native-modules. 

```node: Run
npx expo prebuild
```

The application is installed on the device/emulator.

```node:
npx expo run:[ios] --device
```

#### Android

To link the SDK manually, follow these steps:

1. Open the `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java` file. Add the following to the imports at the top of the file:

      ```java: Import
      import com.razorpay.rn.RazorpayPackage;
      ```

2. Add `new RazorpayPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method.

3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:

      ```java: Settings Gradle
      include ':react-native-razorpay'
      project(':react-native-razorpay').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir,   '../node_modules/react-native-customui/android')
      ```

4. Insert the dependencies in `android/app/build.gradle`:

      ```java: Dependencies
      implementation project(':react-native-customui')
      ```

#### Expo Application

After adding the `react-native-razorpay` package, use the option to prebuild the app. This generates the **android** platform folders in the project to use native-modules. 

```node: Run
npx expo prebuild
```

The application is installed on the device/emulator.

```node:
npx expo run:[android] --device
```

## 1.3 Create an Order in Server

**Order is an important step in the payment process.**

- An order should be created for every payment.
- You can create an order using the [Orders API](#api-sample-code). It is a server-side API call. Know how to [authenticate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) Orders API.
- The `order_id` received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.
> 

You can create an order:
- Using the sample code on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.
- By manually integrating the API sample codes on your server.

#### Razorpay Postman Public Workspace

You can use the Postman workspace below to create an order:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/razorpaydev/workspace/razorpay-public-workspace/request/12492020-6f15a901-06ea-4224-b396-15cd94c6148d)

> **INFO**

> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> Under the **Authorization** section in Postman, select **Basic Auth** and add the Key Id and secret as the Username and Password, respectively.
>

### Request Parameters

`amount` _mandatory_
: `integer` Payment amount in the smallest currency subunit. For example, if the amount to be charged is , then pass `29900` in this field. In the case of three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD and OMR, to accept a payment of 295.991, pass the value as 295990. And in the case of zero decimal currencies such as JPY, to accept a payment of 295, pass the value as 295.

 
> **WARN**
>
> 
>  **Watch Out!**
> 
>  As per payment guidelines, you should pass the last decimal number as 0 for three decimal currency payments. For example, if you want to charge a customer 99.991 KD for a transaction, you should pass the value for the amount parameter as `99990` and not `99991`.
>  

`currency` _mandatory_
: `string` The currency in which the transaction should be made. See the [list of supported currencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/international-payments.md#supported-currencies). Length must be 3 characters.

>  Razorpay has added support for zero decimal currencies, such as JPY and three decimal currencies, such as KWD, BHD and OMR, allowing businesses to accept international payments in these currencies. Know more about [Currency Conversion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/international-payments/currency-conversion.md) (May 2024).
>  

`receipt` _optional_
: `string` Your receipt id for this order should be passed here. Maximum length is 40 characters.

`notes` _optional_
: `json object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

 - `true`: The customer can make partial payments.
 - `false` (default): The customer cannot make partial payments.

`first_payment_min_amount` _optional_
: `integer` Minimum amount that must be paid by the customer as the first partial payment. For example, if an amount of 7000 is to be received from the customer in two installments of #1 - 5000, #2 - 2000 then you can set this value as `500000`. This parameter should be passed only if `partial_payment` is `true`.

### Response Parameters

    Descriptions for the response parameters are present in the [Orders Entity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/orders/entity.md) parameters table.
   

 
### Error Response Parameters

    The error response parameters are available in the [API Reference Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/orders/create.md).
   

## 1.4 Fetch Payment Methods

You can accept payments through UPI, credit and debit cards, netbanking and wallets, as per the methods enabled on your account.

  - When you use Razorpay React Native Standard SDK, you do not have to handle the availability of different payment methods.
  - When creating a Custom checkout form, you must ensure that only the methods activated for your account are displayed to the customer. To get a list of available payment methods, call `getPaymentMethods`. This fetches the list of payment methods asynchronously and returns the result in JSON format in the `onPaymentMethodsReceived` callback.

#### Sample Code
The following API is used to fetch all enabled payment methods for a given API Key ID:

```curl: Curl
https://api.razorpay.com/v1/methods?key_id=[Your_Key_ID]
```

```java: Java
razorpay.getPaymentMethods(new PaymentMethodsCallback() {
	@Override
	public void onPaymentMethodsReceived(String result) {
		JSONObject paymentMethods = new JSONObject(result);
	}

	@Override
	public void onError(String error){

	}
	});
});
```kotlin: Kotlin
 razorpay?.getPaymentMethods(object : PaymentMethodsCallback {
            override fun onPaymentMethodsReceived(result: String?) {
                /**
                 * This returns JSON data
                 * The structure of this data can be seen at the following link:
                 * https://api.razorpay.com/v1/methods?key_id=rzp_test_XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
                 *
                 */
                Log.d("Result", "" + result)
                inflateLists(result)
            }

            override fun onError(error: String?) {
                Log.e("Get Payment error", error)
            }
        })
```

Check the [additional support for payment methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payment-gateway/react-native-integration/custom/additional-features.md) available with the Razorpay React Native Custom SDK.

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> If you are using Subscriptions, you can pass the `subscription_id` in the options, which fetches subscription related details along with the payment method. This saves you a network call to get amount for that `subscription_id`. Know more about [Subscriptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/subscriptions.md).
> 

## 1.5 Import Razorpay Module

Import Razorpay module to your component:

```js: Import
import Razorpay from 'react-native-customui';
```

## 1.6 Add Razorpay Checkout Options to app.js File

Call the `Razorpay.open` method with the payment options. The method returns a JS Promise, where:
  - The then part corresponds to a successful payment.
  - The catch part corresponds to payment failure.

```js: Payment Options
 {
  var options = {
    description: 'Credits towards consultation',
    currency: 'INR',
    key_id: '',
    amount: '50000',
    email: 'gaurav.kumar@example.com',
    contact: '9999999123',
    method: 'netbanking',
    bank: 'HDFC'

  }
  Razorpay.open(options).then((data) => {
    // handle success
    alert(`Success: ${data.razorpay_payment_id}`);
  }).catch((error) => {
    // handle failure
    alert(`Error: ${error.code} | ${error.description}`);
  });
}}>
```

### Success Callback

- You need to store these fields in your server.
- You can confirm the authenticity of these details by verifying the signature in the next step.

```json: Success Callback
{
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f",
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
  "razorpay_signature": "9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d"
}
```

`razorpay_payment_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the payment returned by Checkout **only** for successful payments.

`razorpay_order_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the order returned by Checkout.

`razorpay_signature`
: `string` Signature returned by the Checkout. This is used to verify the payment.
    

## 1.8 Verify Payment Signature

This is a mandatory step to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the Checkout form for successful payments.

  
### To verify the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form:

     1. Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:
        - `order_id`: Retrieve the `order_id` from your server. Do not use the `razorpay_order_id` returned by Checkout.
        - `razorpay_payment_id`: Returned by Checkout.
        - `key_secret`: Available in your server. The `key_secret` that was generated from the [Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys).

     2. Use the SHA256 algorithm, the `razorpay_payment_id` and the `order_id` to construct a HMAC hex digest as shown below:

         ```html: HMAC Hex Digest
         generated_signature = hmac_sha256(order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id, secret);

           if (generated_signature == razorpay_signature) {
             payment is successful
           }
         ```
         
     3. If the signature you generate on your server matches the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form, the payment received is from an authentic source.
    

  
### Generate Signature on Your Server

Given below is the sample code for payment signature verification:

```java: Java
RazorpayClient razorpay = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

String secret = "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";

JSONObject options = new JSONObject();
options.put("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3");
options.put("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.put("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f");

boolean status =  Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options, secret);

```php: PHP
$api = new Api($key_id, $secret);

$api->utility->verifyPaymentSignature(array('razorpay_order_id' => $razorpayOrderId, 'razorpay_payment_id' => $razorpayPaymentId, 'razorpay_signature' => $razorpaySignature));

```ruby: Ruby
require "razorpay"
Razorpay.setup('YOUR_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET')

payment_response = {
       razorpay_order_id: 'order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3',
       razorpay_payment_id: 'pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l',
       razorpay_signature: '0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f'
     }
Razorpay::Utility.verify_payment_signature(payment_response)

```python: Python
import razorpay
client = razorpay.Client(auth=("YOUR_ID", "YOUR_SECRET"))

client.utility.verify_payment_signature({
  'razorpay_order_id': razorpay_order_id,
  'razorpay_payment_id': razorpay_payment_id,
  'razorpay_signature': razorpay_signature
  })

```c: .NET
RazorpayClient client = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

Dictionary options = new Dictionary();
options.Add("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65");
options.Add("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.Add("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50");

Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options);

```nodejs: Node.js
var instance = new Razorpay({ key_id: 'YOUR_KEY_ID', key_secret: 'YOUR_SECRET' })

var { validatePaymentVerification, validateWebhookSignature } = require('./dist/utils/razorpay-utils');
validatePaymentVerification({"order_id": razorpayOrderId, "payment_id": razorpayPaymentId }, signature, secret);

```Go: Go
import ( razorpay "github.com/razorpay/razorpay-go" )
client := razorpay.NewClient("YOUR_KEY_ID", "YOUR_SECRET")

params := map[string]interface{}{
 "razorpay_order_id": "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3",
 "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l",
}

signature := "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f";
secret := "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";
utils.VerifyPaymentSignature(params, signature, secret)
```

    

  
### Post Signature Verification

After you have completed the integration, you can [set up webhooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md), make test payments, replace the test key with the live key and integrate with other [APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api.md).

## 1.9 Verify Payment Status

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> On the Razorpay Dashboard, ensure that the payment status is `captured`. Refer to the payment capture settings page to know how to [capture payments automatically](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).
> 

    
### You can track the payment status in three ways:

    
        To verify the payment status from the Razorpay Dashboard:

        1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to **Transactions** → **Payments**.
        2. Check if a **Payment Id** has been generated and note the status. In case of a successful payment, the status is marked as **Captured**.
        ![](/docs/assets/images/testpayment.jpg)
    
    
        You can use Razorpay webhooks to configure and receive notifications when a specific event occurs. When one of these events is triggered, we send an HTTP POST payload in JSON to the webhook's configured URL. Know how to [set up webhooks.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md)

        #### Example
        If you have subscribed to the `order.paid` webhook event, you will receive a notification every time a customer pays you for an order.
    
    
        [Poll Payment APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/payments/fetch-all-payments.md) to check the payment status.

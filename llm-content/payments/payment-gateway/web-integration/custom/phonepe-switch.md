title: PhonePe Switch Integration
description: Integrate your Razorpay Custom web application to accept payments in PhonePe Switch platform.
---

# PhonePe Switch Integration

PhonePe Switch platform allows customers to switch seamlessly between PhonePe and their preferred apps within the PhonePe app itself. With a single tap, customers can log in to these apps without downloading them. For example, customers can book cabs or hotel rooms right on the PhonePe app and utilize offers provided by PhonePe.

PhonePe enables various businesses to integrate their web apps or mobile sites with the Switch platform and instantly reach out to the PhonePe user base. By integrating Razorpay APIs with PhonePe Switch payment flow, you can accept in-app payments made by your customers without having to worry about handling settlements or reconciliation separately.

## User Flow

The user's journey through this entire flow is outlined below:

1. Customers log in to the PhonePe app and click **PhonePe Switch**.
2. In the PhonePe Switch, customers select your app, place orders and click **Proceed to Pay**.
3. Customers are redirected to the PhonePe payment page.
4. After the successful payment on the PhonePe payment page, customers are redirected to your website.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating with the Checkout, run through this checklist:

- Check if your webapp is integrated with PhonePe Switch.
-  Understand the [payment flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payment-gateway/how-it-works.md).
-  Sign up for a Razorpay Account.
- Generate the API keys from the [Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings.md#api-keys). Use the test API Keys to test out the integration.

Watch the video to see how to generate API key in Test Mode.

### Step 1: Create an Order in your Server

When a customer places an order on your website or application, use the details to create an order on Razorpay.

/orders

```curl: Request
curl -u [YOUR_KEY_ID]:[YOUR_KEY_SECRET] \
-X POST https://api.razorpay.com/v1/orders \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "INR",
    "receipt": "merchant_txn_id"
    "phonepe_switch_context" : "{\n\"orderContext\":{\"trackingInfo\":{\n\"type\":\"HTTPS\",\"url\":\"https://google.com\"}},\"fareDetails\":{\n\"payableAmount\":3900,\"totalAmount\":3900},\"cartDetails\":{\"cartItems\":[{\"quantity\":1,\"address\":{\"addressString\":\"TEST\",\"city\":\"TEST\",\"pincode\":\"TEST\",\"country\":\"TEST\",\n\"latitude\":1,\"longitude\":1},\"shippingInfo\":{\n\"deliveryType\":\"STANDARD\",\"time\":{\"timestamp\":1561540218,\"zoneOffSet\":\"+05:30\"\n\n\n}},\n\n\n\n\n\"category\":\"SHOPPING\",\"itemId\":\"1234567890\",\n\"price\":3900,\"itemName\":\"TEST\"}]}}"
}'
```json: Response
{
    "id": "order_EdUtuxhupLSOUH",
    "entity": "order",
    "amount": 1000,
    "amount_paid": 0,
    "amount_due": 1000,
    "currency": "INR",
    "receipt": "merchant_txn_id",
    "offer_id": null,
    "status": "created",
    "attempts": 0,
    "notes": [],
    "created_at": 1586677700
}
```

#### Request Parameters

`amount` _mandatory_
: `integer` The transaction amount, expressed in the currency subunit, such as paise (in case of INR). For example, for an actual amount of ₹299.35, the value of this field should be `29935`.

`currency` _mandatory_
: `string` The currency in which the transaction should be made. 
 You can create Orders in **INR** only.

`receipt` _optional_
: `string` Your receipt ID for this order can be passed here. Maximum length is 40 characters.

`phonepe_switch_context` _optional_

`notes` _optional_
: `object` Key-value pair that can be used to store additional information about the entity. Maximum 15 key-value pairs, 256 characters (maximum) each. For example, `"note_key": "Beam me up Scotty”`.

### Step 2: Invoke Checkout and Pass Order Id and Other Options to it

#### Step 2.1: Include the JavaScript code in your Webpage

Include the following script, preferably in `` section of your page:

```html: Index HTML

```

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Including the Javascript, not the Library**
> 
> Include the script from `https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/razorpay.js` instead of serving a copy from your own server. This allows new updates and bug fixes to the library to get automatically served to your application.
> 
> We always maintain backward compatibility with our code.
> 

#### Step 2.2: Instantiate Razorpay Custom Checkout

#### Single Instance on a Page

```js: Invoke a Single Instance
var razorpay = new Razorpay({
  key: '',
    // logo, displayed in the payment processing popup
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5tjHFD.jpg',
});
```

#### Multiple Instances on Same Page

If you need multiple razorpay instances on same page, you can globally set some of the options:

```js: Invoke Multiple Instances
Razorpay.configure({
  key: '',
    // logo, displayed in the payment processing popup
  image: 'https://i.imgur.com/n5tjHFD.jpg',
})
new Razorpay({}); // will inherit key and image from above.
```
#### Step 2.3: Submit Payment Details

Once the order is created and the customer's payment details are obtained, the information should be sent to Razorpay to complete the payment. The data that needs to be submitted depends upon the payment method selected by the customer.

You can do this by invoking `createPayment` method:

```js: createPayment with handler Function
  var data = {
    amount: 1000, // in currency subunits. Here 1000 = 1000 paise, which equals to ₹10
    currency: "INR",
    email: 'gaurav.kumar@example.com',
    contact: '9123456780',
    notes: {
    address: 'Ground Floor, SJR Cyber, Laskar Hosur Road, Bengaluru',
    },
    order_id: "order_EdUtuxhupLSOUH", // Enter the order ID obtained from Step 1
    method: 'wallet',
    wallet: 'phonepeswitch'
    };

    var btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
    btn.addEventListener('click', function(){
    razorpay.createPayment(data);

    razorpay.on('payment.success', function(resp){
        alert(resp.razorpay_payment_id),
        alert(resp.razorpay_order_id),
        alert(resp.razorpay_signature)
        }); // will pass payment ID, order ID, and Razorpay signature to success handler.

    razorpay.on('payment.error', function(resp){
        alert(resp.error.description)}); // will pass error object to error handler
  });
```js: createPayment with callback URL
  var data = {
    callback_url: 'https://www.examplecallbackurl.com/',
    amount: 1000, // in currency subunits. Here 1000 = 1000 paise, which equals to ₹10
    currency: "INR",
    email: 'gaurav.kumar@example.com',
    contact: '9123456780',
    notes: {
    address: 'Ground Floor, SJR Cyber, Laskar Hosur Road, Bengaluru',
    },
    order_id: "order_EdUtuxhupLSOUH", // Enter the order ID obtained from Step 1
    method: 'wallet',
    wallet: 'phonepeswitch'
    };

    var btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
    btn.addEventListener('click', function(){
    razorpay.createPayment(data);
  });
```

> **ERROR**
>
> 
> **Note**
> 
> The `createPayment` method should be called within an event listener triggered by user action to prevent the popup from being blocked. For example:
> 

> ```js
> $('button').click( function (){ razorpay.createPayment(...) })
> ```
> 

> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handler Function vs Callback URL**
> 
> - **Handler Function**:
>   
When you use the handler function, the response object of the successful payment (`razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id` and `razorpay_signature`) is submitted to the Checkout Form. You need to collect these and send them to your server.
> - **Callback URL**:
>   
When you use a Callback URL, the response object of the successful payment (`razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_order_id` and `razorpay_signature`) is submitted to the Callback URL.
> 

### Step 3: Store Fields in Your Server

A successful payment returns the following fields to the Checkout form.

  
### Success Callback

- You need to store these fields in your server.
- You can confirm the authenticity of these details by verifying the signature in the next step.

```json: Success Callback
{
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f",
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
  "razorpay_signature": "9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d"
}
```

`razorpay_payment_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the payment returned by Checkout **only** for successful payments.

`razorpay_order_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the order returned by Checkout.

`razorpay_signature`
: `string` Signature returned by the Checkout. This is used to verify the payment.
    

### Step 4: Verify the Signature

This is a mandatory step to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the Checkout form for successful payments.

  
### To verify the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form:

     1. Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:
        - `order_id`: Retrieve the `order_id` from your server. Do not use the `razorpay_order_id` returned by Checkout.
        - `razorpay_payment_id`: Returned by Checkout.
        - `key_secret`: Available in your server. The `key_secret` that was generated from the [Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys).

     2. Use the SHA256 algorithm, the `razorpay_payment_id` and the `order_id` to construct a HMAC hex digest as shown below:

         ```html: HMAC Hex Digest
         generated_signature = hmac_sha256(order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id, secret);

           if (generated_signature == razorpay_signature) {
             payment is successful
           }
         ```
         
     3. If the signature you generate on your server matches the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form, the payment received is from an authentic source.
    

  
### Generate Signature on Your Server

Given below is the sample code for payment signature verification:

```java: Java
RazorpayClient razorpay = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

String secret = "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";

JSONObject options = new JSONObject();
options.put("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3");
options.put("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.put("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f");

boolean status =  Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options, secret);

```php: PHP
$api = new Api($key_id, $secret);

$api->utility->verifyPaymentSignature(array('razorpay_order_id' => $razorpayOrderId, 'razorpay_payment_id' => $razorpayPaymentId, 'razorpay_signature' => $razorpaySignature));

```ruby: Ruby
require "razorpay"
Razorpay.setup('YOUR_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET')

payment_response = {
       razorpay_order_id: 'order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3',
       razorpay_payment_id: 'pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l',
       razorpay_signature: '0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f'
     }
Razorpay::Utility.verify_payment_signature(payment_response)

```python: Python
import razorpay
client = razorpay.Client(auth=("YOUR_ID", "YOUR_SECRET"))

client.utility.verify_payment_signature({
  'razorpay_order_id': razorpay_order_id,
  'razorpay_payment_id': razorpay_payment_id,
  'razorpay_signature': razorpay_signature
  })

```c: .NET
RazorpayClient client = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

Dictionary options = new Dictionary();
options.Add("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65");
options.Add("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.Add("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50");

Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options);

```nodejs: Node.js
var instance = new Razorpay({ key_id: 'YOUR_KEY_ID', key_secret: 'YOUR_SECRET' })

var { validatePaymentVerification, validateWebhookSignature } = require('./dist/utils/razorpay-utils');
validatePaymentVerification({"order_id": razorpayOrderId, "payment_id": razorpayPaymentId }, signature, secret);

```Go: Go
import ( razorpay "github.com/razorpay/razorpay-go" )
client := razorpay.NewClient("YOUR_KEY_ID", "YOUR_SECRET")

params := map[string]interface{}{
 "razorpay_order_id": "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3",
 "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l",
}

signature := "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f";
secret := "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";
utils.VerifyPaymentSignature(params, signature, secret)
```

    

  
### Post Signature Verification

After you have completed the integration, you can [set up webhooks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md), make test payments, replace the test key with the live key and integrate with other [APIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api.md).
    

## Payment Capture Settings

After payment is `authorized`, you need to capture it to settle the amount to your bank account as per the settlement schedule. Payments that are not captured are auto-refunded after a fixed time.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> 
> **Watch Out**
> 
> - You should deliver the products or services to your customers only after the payment is captured. Razorpay automatically refunds all the uncaptured payments.
> - You can track the payment status using our [Fetch a Payment API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/payments.md#fetch-a-payment) or webhooks.
> 

  
    Authorized payments can be automatically captured. You can auto-capture all payments [using global settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payments/capture-settings.md#auto-capture-all-payments) on the Razorpay Dashboard. Know more about [capture settings for payments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).

    
> **WARN**
>
> 
>     **Watch Out!**
> 
>     Payment capture settings work only if you have integrated with Orders API on your server side. Know more about the [Orders API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/orders/create.md).
>     

  
  
    Each authorized payment can also be captured individually. You can manually capture payments using [Payment Capture API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/api/payments.md#capture-a-payment) or [Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payments/dashboard.md#manually-capture-payments). Know more about [capture settings for payments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).
  

After the integration is complete, a **Pay** button appears on your webpage/app. 

![Test integration on your webpage/app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/assets/images/test-int.gif.md)

Click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test transaction is successful.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> This is a mock payment page that uses your test API keys, test card and payment details. 
> - Ensure you have entered only your [Test Mode API keys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) in the Checkout code. 
> - Test mode features a mock bank page with **Success** and **Failure** buttons to replicate the live payment experience.
> - No real money is deducted due to the usage of test API keys. This is a simulated transaction.
> 

Following are all the payment modes that the customer can use to complete the payment on the Checkout. Some of them are available by default, while others may require approval from us. Raise a request from the Dashboard to enable such payment methods.

### Netbanking

         You can select any of the listed banks. After choosing a bank, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the bank login portals.

         Check the list of [supported banks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payment-methods/netbanking.md#supported-banks).
        

    
### UPI

         You can enter one of the following UPI IDs:

         - `success@razorpay`: To make the payment successful. 
         - `failure@razorpay`: To fail the payment.

         Check the list of [supported UPI flows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razorpay/razorpay-php-testapp/markdown-docs/llm-content/payments/payment-methods/upi.md).

### Wallet

         You can select any of the listed wallets. After choosing a wallet, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the wallet login portals.

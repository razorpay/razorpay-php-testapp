# 1. Create the Authorisation Transaction

Given below are the steps to create an authorisation transaction using the Razorpay APIs.

## 1.1 Create a Customer 

@include recurring-payments/customer/api

    
### Request Parameters

         @include recurring-payments/customer/api-req
        

    
### Response Parameters

         @include recurring-payments/customer/api-res
        

## 1.2 Create an Order 

The Orders API allows you to create a unique Razorpay `order_id`, for example, `order_1Aa00000000001`, that would be tied to the authorisation transaction. Refer to our detailed [Order documentation](@/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/new-docs/llm-content/payments/orders.md) for more details.

Use the below endpoint to create an order.

/orders

You can create a payment against the `order_id` once it is generated.
